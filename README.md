# International Days
I have seen the claim that ["International Men's Day searches spike on International Women's Day"](https://mashable.com/2018/03/08/mens-day-searches-spike-on-womens-day/?europe=true#ZEhletJ7Haqd) from several sources. They rely on publicly available data. Is the claim justified?

I compare search behavior (Google Trends) across men's, women's and transgender international day in [comparison_men_vs_women_day.ipynb](https://github.com/lukaselflein/international_days/blob/master/comparison_men_vs_women_day.ipynb).
